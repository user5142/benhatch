        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a writer, maker and above all else, family man. The best things in life I have
            ever done
            were marrying my wife and becoming a dad.</p>

        <p>I grew up in a small town in Massachusetts. I studied business at the University of Vermont, then moved
            back to Massachusetts and have lived here ever since. I
            will probably be a New Englander for life. I considered a move to the West Coast to chase lofty dreams
            in my twenties, but it never panned out, which I am grateful for. I have fallen further in love with the
            farms, mountains, forests, rivers, disc golf courses and seasons of my home turf as I have gotten older.
        </p>
        <p>I have had many passions and interests over the years, but one constant is that I have always been
            obsessed with creating. As a young boy, I used to draw freehand copies of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and
            other
            Disney characters. In my teen years, I fell in love with freestyle skiing, built terrain park
            features in my backyard and produced skiing videos with my friends. In my twenties, I made short films,
            wrote movie scripts, became a standup comic and co-founded a CBD business. These
            days, I am writing on my <a href="https://benhatch.com/blog">blog</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The act of creating brings me lots of fulfillment. I love making things and putting them out into the world.</p>
