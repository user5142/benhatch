            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hello fellow citizen of the internet! Thanks for stopping by and taking some time to learn more about me.
            </p>
            <p>I am a regular guy from a middle class background who grew up in a small town in Massachusetts. I went to
                college at the University of Vermont, then moved back to Massachusetts and have lived here ever since. I
                will probably be a New Englander for life. I considered a move to the West Coast to chase lofty dreams
                in my twenties, but it never panned out, which I am grateful for. I have fallen further in love with the
                farms, mountains, forests, rivers, disc golf courses and seasons of my home turf as I have gotten older.
            </p>
            <p>I have had many passions and interests over the years, but one constant is that I have always been
                obsessed with creating. As a young boy, I used to draw pictures of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and other
                Disney characters. In my teen years, I fell in love with freestyle skiing, built terrain park
                features in my backyard and produced skiing videos with my friends. In my twenties, I made short films,
                wrote movie scripts, became a standup comedian, and co-founded a CBD business. These days, I design and
                develop <a href="https://townforest.co/" target="_blank">websites and brand identities</a>, write <a href="https://benhatch.com/blog">articles</a>, produce <a herf="https://www.youtube.com/@hatch2k3" target="_blank">YouTube videos</a> and build internet businesses.
            </p>
            <p>The act of creating brings me lots of fulfillment. I love making things that others can enjoy and benefit
                from. I also have a highly curious mind, and a strong appetite for learning. I have taught myself how to
                code, design, write, invest, produce videos, manage finances, start a business, think critically about
                the world and much more.</p>
            <p>This website serves as the central hub for all of my creative and business endeavors. I hope to share
                hard-earned wisdom, <a href="https://benhatch.com/shop">useful products</a>, interesting business lessons and high-quality dad jokes on here and
                other channels.</p>
            <p>To learn more about what I am up to now, check out my <a href="https://benhatch.com/now">now</a> page. I will add more here later, but right now I
                am a tired dad up past his bedtime.</p>
