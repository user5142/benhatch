        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a writer, internet maker and above all else, family man. The best things in life I have
            ever done
            were marrying my wife and becoming a dad.</p>

        <p>I grew up in a small town in Massachusetts. I studied business at the University of Vermont, then moved
            back to Massachusetts and have lived here ever since. I
            will probably be a New Englander for life. I considered a move to the West Coast to chase lofty dreams
            in my twenties, but it never panned out, which I am grateful for. I have fallen further in love with the
            farms, mountains, forests, rivers, disc golf courses and seasons of my home turf as I have gotten older.
        </p>
        <p>I have had many passions and interests over the years, but one constant is that I have always been
            obsessed with creating. As a young boy, I used to draw freehand copies of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and
            other
            Disney characters. In my teen years, I fell in love with freestyle skiing, built terrain park
            features in my backyard and produced skiing videos with my friends. In my twenties, I made short films,
            wrote movie scripts, became a standup comic and co-founded a CBD business. These
            days, I am building <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrMarketStories" target="_blank">MrMarket</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The act of creating brings me lots of fulfillment. I love making things that others can enjoy and benefit
            from. I also have a highly curious mind, and a strong appetite for learning. I have taught myself how to
            code, design, write, invest, produce videos, <a
                href="https://benhatch.com/blog/personalfinanceprocess">manage finances</a>, start a business, think
            critically about
            the world and much more.</p>
        <p>This website serves as the central hub for all of my creative and business endeavors. I hope to share
            hard-earned wisdom, <a href="https://benhatch.com/shop">useful products</a>, interesting business
            lessons and high caliber dad jokes on here and
            other channels.</p>
