        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello friend! Thanks for stopping by and taking some time to learn more about me.</p>
        <p>Where to begin? Well, I am mostly just a regular guy from a middle class background who has been dealt a few
            crappy hands, but has also had some nice luck, wins and redemption in life.</p>
        <p>I grew up in a small town in Massachusetts, about 40 minutes east of Boston. My college friend Mark used to
            joke that every person he meets from Massachusetts is from a small town 40 minutes outside of Boston. I
            think there’s some truth to that.</p>
        <p>When I was 14, my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Two years later, she passed away. This was a big inflection
            point in my life. Everything up until her diagnosis felt like the white picket fence American dream in our
            family. Life felt like Frodo Baggins in the Shire before he found the ring. Happy, healthy and full of
            adventure. And everything that came after felt like Frodo facing his long and perilous journey to Mordor.
        </p>
        <p>Losing my mom was very hard on me, but I tried even harder to pretend that I was okay. I thought it was my
            duty as a young man to show no weakness. So I didn’t cry, didn’t talk much about it and carried on. This
            ultimately lead to a total mental and emotional breakdown that landed me in a psychiatric hospital on my
            21st birthday. My body could no longer handle the delayed grief. My psyche could no longer bear the weight
            of denial.</p>
        <p>The following year was the hardest of my life. I had to stay home and miss my senior year of college to
            recover. The doctors couldn’t really pinpoint what happened to me, but chalked it up as an episode of
            <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/delirium/symptoms-causes/syc-20371386" target="_blank">delirium</a>. Whatever it was, it KO’d me like a Wonderboy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvVeTigbn9c" target="_blank">karate kick</a> to the soul. I sank into a deep
            depression. I felt isolated and alone. I had to sit on the sidelines while my friends danced across the
            finish line of senior year. I cycled through a number of different medications, all of which made me feel
            worse.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, I was eventually able to crawl out of the pits of despair with the support of friends, family
            and the talented healthcare practitioners of the Greater Boston area. I returned to college a year later and
            finished out my degree strong. It was a long road to recovery, but I was back to feeling like myself and
            enjoying life again.</p>
        <p>I wish that I could say it was smooth sailing from there, that things stayed on the up and up and I knocked
            down the challenges of career, romance and young adulthood like Gronk stiff-arming his way to the endzone.
            But alas, this was not the case. Not at all.</p>
        <p>My twenties panned out more like the Mark Sanchez <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82RIfy-gRa4" taret="_blank">butt fumble</a>. I landed a promising job at a growing software
            startup soon after graduation, only to get my heart broken by a colleague, burn out and quit a year later. I
            hopped from job to job, not giving myself enough of a chance to grow and leaving a trail of less than ideal
            resume milestones. I let my drinking habits get out of control, picked a fight on a particularly belligerent
            night, and got my jaw broken in two places. The attractive young Brazilian woman I had been dating at the
            time stopped talking to me (can’t blame her). I quit my job and decided to become a rideshare driver while
            pursuing freelance filmmaking. I went on to spend so much time in the car giving rides that I developed
            chronic back pain. The list goes on and on. You get the gist.</p>
        <p>Although I have many regrets from these young adult years, as mentioned before, my story is not all doom,
            gloom and foibles. Lady luck, and perhaps a few guardian angels, have had my back many times over. For
            example, the double fracture of my jaw turned out to be a clean break and not displaced, and therefore did
            not require any surgery. I was back to work in less than a week, and the fractures healed naturally. I have
            had many such lucky breaks (pun intended) throughout my life.</p>
        <p>More important than the favors of chance, I have been able to, slowly but surely, learn the important lessons
            behind my missteps. As I finally began to put the pieces together in my late twenties and transitioned into
            my thirties, things started to click. I cut out the bad habits that had been sabotaging my potential,
            including weed and alcohol. I found a steady job that I could settle into and build upon. I prioritized
            relationships and set a goal to find a girlfriend. I met this goal and found the love of my life in the
            middle of a pandemic. One year after meeting, we got married. A year after that, we had our first
            kid. Through it all, I focused on relentless improvement of my finances, fitness and career development.
            Mistakes and missteps were still made, but I now had the fortified foundation in place to bounce back from
            them quickly and course correct.</p>
        <p>Things have gotten much better for me, but I don’t have it all figured out by any means. I am continually
            striving to learn and improve, while making plenty more mistakes along the way. Through this website and
            other channels, I hope to share some of my hard earned wisdom with others. I have found it quite fun to
            organize my thoughts into writing, transmit them across hundreds of miles of cables, routers, switches and
            servers, and deliver them to a few people on the internet who might find them helpful or entertaining.</p>
