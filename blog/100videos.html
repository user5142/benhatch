            <p>I love the simplicity and power of The Law of 100. It applies to starting something new, and
                involves doing the thing - writing articles, designing websites, making short films, whatever the thing
                is - 100 times and getting the reps in before worrying about optimization or results.</p>
            <p>In thinking back on my prior business and creative endeavors, I would have been served well to follow The
                Law of 100 and give myself a fair shot at success. I feel there were several pursuits
                in my past that I could have turned into something if I had just stuck it out and focused on getting
                those first 100 reps in.</p>
            <p>In the spirit of not repeating history, I have committed to following The Law of 100 for my new MrMarket
                project. I will be making 100 videos for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrMarketStories"
                    target="_blank">MrMarket YouTube channel</a>. There
                is one simple
                rule: the videos can consist of both longform and shorts, but they must be unique content. I may
                re-purpose some videos, but this won't count towards the challenge.</p>
            <p>As I publish each video, I will post them to the list below until I reach the 100 mark. I am very excited
                to focus on the process, hone my skills and become a disciple of The Law of 100!</p>
