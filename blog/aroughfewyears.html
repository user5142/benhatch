            <p>It had been a rough few years for her.</p>
            <p>There was the vomiting. She could barely go a meal without something coming back up. There were the falls. She fell at home, at the park, at the doctor’s office. Her balance just wasn’t quite there. There were the colds, which left lingering coughs that could last for months. Then there was the choking incident. From a slightly oversized Brussels sprout, of all things.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, the tide turned for her. She found her stride. No more falling and choking and vomiting. A new sun had risen. She was ready for kindergarten.</p>
