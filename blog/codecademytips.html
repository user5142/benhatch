        <p>Back in December of 2022, I embarked on Codecademy’s <a href="https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path-b/" target="_blank">Full-Stack Engineer Path</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The course teaches the necessary skills to build web applications from start to finish and launch a career as a Full-Stack Software Engineer.</p>
        <p>As of this writing, I am one-third of the way through the course and have enjoyed it more than I could have imagined. Learning about the foundational technologies of the web has been fascinating, and I love being able to learn at my own pace through the online, asynchronous format.</p>
        <div class="blog-image">
            <img src="blog-images/codecademy-progress.png" alt="A screenshot of the Codecademy progress bar of the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path.">
        </div>
        <p>Platforms like Codecademy are well suited for self-starters. You get what you put into it. Staying motivated and utilizing the many resources at your disposal will help you get the most value out of the subscription.</p>
        <p>I still have a ways to go towards completing the Full-Stack Career Path, but have picked up some helpful learning strategies along the way.</p>
        <p>Read on for 3 tips to maximize the Codecademy experience and get the most value out of your online coding education.</p>
        <h3>1) Build a knowledge repository</h3>
        <p>One limitation of Codecademy I have found is that it is fairly difficult to return to previous modules and lessons to review material.</p>
        <p>A key part of learning to code is revisiting lessons and documentation over and over to help solve problems and refresh your knowledge.</p>
        <p>To solve this limitation, I created my own “KnowledgeHub” repository to store all Codecademy lessons as I complete them. Whenever I need to review material from a prior module, I can simply flip through my KnowledgeHub folders within VSCode for quick and easy access to my previous work.</p>

            <img src="blog-images/codecademy-knowledgehub.png" alt="A screenshot of a KnowledgeHub repository within VSCode.">
        </div>
        <h3>2) Frequent the forums</h3>
        <p>I have been a part of several online forum communities over the years. The <a href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy forums</a> are among the most positive and supportive I have come across.</p>
        <p>Utilizing the Codecademy forums is very helpful for solving coding problems, connecting with other developers and getting feedback on your work.</p>
        <p>The forums are also a great place to hone your coding skills. Other Codecademy learners consistently post coding problems they are struggling with, which is a great opportunity to take a crack at solving them and help out fellow students.
        </p>
        <h3>3) Polish portfolio projects</h3>
        <p>The thing I most look forward to within the Full-Stack Engineer Path are the portfolio projects. They present an opportunity to utilize all of your knowledge and skills to build a web project infused with your unique creativity and perspective.</p>
        <p>It can be tempting to blaze through the portfolio projects so that you can keep moving that progress bar along and work towards completion of a course. I find that resisting this urge and spending the extra time and effort on each portfolio project pays big dividends.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the portfolio projects you complete teach you the most and become part of your developer resume. They can be prominently displayed on a personal website, and can go a long way towards helping you land a full-time job or freelance work.</p>

        <p>I hope these simple tips can help other Codecademy learners out there maximize their online education. Feel free to <a href="https://benhatch.com/#contact">reach out</a> if you have any questions or helpful tips of your own to share!</p>
