            <p>The internet is a treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom for indie makers, as long as you spend your
                energy
                in the right places.</p>
            <p>I find that I gain the most value (and feel the best mentally) when I minimize my intake of knee-jerk,
                short-form content and focus on high-quality, long-form channels.</p>
            <p>Maker blogs are, in my opinion, some of the best places to hang out and gather insights on the web. A
                good
                maker blog can encompass entire career trajectories, life philosophies and fountains of wisdom within
                the
                depths of its posts.</p>
            <p>Here are three seasoned makers who have cultivated timeless blogs that span the course of decades and
                explore
                indie business, philosophy, lifestyle and more.</p>
            <strong>
                <p>1) <a href="https://tim.blog/" target="_blank">Tim Ferris</a></p>
            </strong>
            <p>Tim is a writer, investor, podcaster and OG blogger, among many other things.
            </p>
            <p>Tim has been building in public and living the indie life way before it was cool. I remember being
                fascinated
                by his ponderings on lifestyle design, biohacking and internet business when I first discovered his work
                over ten years ago back in my college days.</p>
            <p>Tim's blog has been active for over a decade and contains north of 1,000 articles. The best place to
                start as
                a newcomer is the <a href="https://tim.blog/new-start-here/" target="_blank">New? Start Here</a> page,
                where
                Tim highlights some of his top posts by category.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/tim-blog-home.png"
                    alt="A screenshot of the landing page of the blog of Tim Ferriss.">
            </div>
            <p>One of my favorite articles and a tim.blog classic is <a
                    href="https://tim.blog/2020/02/02/reasons-to-not-become-famous/" target="_blank">11 Reasons Not to
                    Become Famous (or “A Few Lessons Learned Since 2007”)</a>. Like much of Tim's writing, it tells a
                compelling and highly entertaining story, touches upon sensitive subject matter and sprinkles in nuggets
                of
                wisdom, parables and humor throughout.</p>
            <p>I have a lot of respect for Tim as a maker, man and human being. Amidst his massive success in business
                and
                life, he makes a concerted effort to share the dark aspects of his personal journey, including
                experiences
                with <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/09/16/how-to-heal-trauma-transcript/" target="_blank">childhood
                    abuse</a> and <a href="https://tim.blog/2015/05/06/how-to-commit-suicide/"
                    target="_blank">suicide</a>,
                in hopes of breaking taboos and helping others.</p>
            <p>I look forward to reading more of Tim's work and re-visiting his blog whenever I need to zoom out, check
                in
                with myself or take a long sip from a steaming hot cup of wisdom.</p>
            <strong>
                <p>2) <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/" target="_blank">Justin Jackson</a></p>
            </strong>
            <p>Justin is a maker, podcaster and co-founder of <a href="https://transistor.fm/"
                    target="_blank">Transistor.fm</a>, a podcast hosting SaaS business.</p>
            <p>I only recently discovered <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/articles" target="_blank">Justin's blog</a>
                earlier this year, but it has quickly become one of my go-tos. He has compiled an impressive archive of
                over
                300 articles, with his <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/hello-world" target="_blank">first post</a>
                dating
                all the way back to August 13th, 2008 (my 18th birthday 😄).</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/justin-jackson-first-post.png"
                    alt="A screenshot of the first post from Justin Jackson's blog.">
            </div>
            <p>Justin writes at the intersection of SaaS, bootstrapping, lifestyle, mental models and business ethics.
                His
                articles are thoughtful, practical and easy to digest.</p>
            <p><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/the-principle-that-changed-my-life" target="_blank">The 80% energy
                    principle</a> is one of my favorites and touches upon a recurring theme in Justin's writing: seeking
                healthy margins in both business and life.</p>
            <p><a href="https://justinjackson.ca/build" target="_blank">How do I build something people want?</a> is
                another
                fantastic read and would serve anyone trying to find strong product ideas or launch a successful
                business
                well.</p>
            <p>I've only hit the tip of the iceberg with Justin's blog and will continue to sift through his sea of
                ideas
                and experiences as I build and bootstrap my own projects.</p>
            <strong>
                <p>3) <a href="https://levels.io/blog/" target="_blank">Pieter Levels</a></p>
            </strong>
            <p>Pieter is an indiepreneur, digital nomad and serial founder of many projects and businesses.</p>
            <p>Simply put, Levels is built different. He ships new projects and features at warp speed, lives at the
                forefront of emerging trends like remote work and async, and fortunately for us all, documents the
                journey
                in detail as he goes.</p>
            <p>I discovered Levels through Twitter earlier this year and was happy to stumble upon <a
                    href="https://levels.io/blog/" target="_blank">his blog</a>, which dates back to 2011 and rings in
                at
                243 posts and counting.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/pieter-blog.png" alt="A screenshot of the blog of Pieter Levels.">
            </div>
            <p>Pieter's blog posts reflect his eclectic and far reaching interests, which he has managed to meld
                together
                into an ever-accelerating flywheel that serves as the launching pad and foundation of his business
                endeavors
                and success.</p>
            <p><a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/" target="_blank">I'm Launching 12 Startups in 12
                    Months</a>
                is a Levels classic and gives a good glimpse into his strategies of starting small, launching fast and
                iterating often.</p>
            <p><a href="https://levels.io/reset-your-life/" target="_blank">Reset your life</a> is a great early post
                that
                touches on mental health, breaking comfort zones and minimalist living, the soul-centric themes that
                weave
                throughout Pieter's journey and writings.</p>
            <p>I will surely be revisiting Pieter's idea-rich blog for years to come and look forward to his continued
                evolution as a maker, writer and entrepreneur.</p>
