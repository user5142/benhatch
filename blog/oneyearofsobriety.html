            <p>To be honest, the internet does not need another sobriety reflection post.</p>
            <p>A Google search for <i>lessons learned from getting sober</i> returns 311 million results and an ungodly
                amount of
                <i>X Lessons Learned in X Years of Sobriety</i> articles.
            </p>
            <p>Sobriety has entered the zeitgeist and been on the up and up. Influencers shill mocktails on social
                media.
                Addiction memoirs have become a literary staple. Micro breweries and massive beverage conglomerates have
                all
                hopped on the NA bandwagon. Heck, I even came across a non-alcoholic canned <a
                    href="https://untappd.com/b/jeju-beer-company-jeju-nouveau/5323304" target="_blank">pale ale
                    microbrew</a> in South Korea last month (it was fire).</p>
            <p>The sobriety content canon these days is an endless stream of books, podcasts, blogs and videos touting
                the benefits of a sober lifestyle. The last thing we need is another insufferable millennial to tell us
                about his little sobriety achievement.</p>
            <p>But you know what? Sometimes a millennial succumbs to their true nature.</p>
            <p>Today I hit one full year of sobriety, for the first time ever. So I will do my little victory lap and
                unabashedly preach to the internet about one lesson I learned from the past year.</p>
            <p><span>1) Abstinence is easier than moderation</span></p>
            <p>Going sober reduces the amount of decisions you need to make.</p>
            <p><i>What should I drink?</i></p>
            <p><i>Who’s driving tonight?</i></p>
            <p><i>If I have one more Heady Topper, how bad will my diarrhea be in the morning?</i></p>
            <p>All of these micro decisions and scenarios that inevitably come up in social settings are null and void when you are sober. They are replaced by one guiding principle. You don’t drink. You don’t smoke. You don’t do nitrous balloons on night three at MSG.</p>
            <p>This is not to say that abstinence is easy. It is very difficult, especially in the beginning. But eventually, once you successfully stumble through a few social events sober and figure out how to defend against offers of substances and unwanted interactions with intoxicated people, the scale tips. </p>
            <p>Then, instead of being bogged down by micro decisions, you can focus on the important questions. </p>
            <p><i>Are we alone?</i></p>
            <p><i>What’s the meaning of life?</i></p>
            <p><i>Will the Costco $1.50 hot dog meal survive inflation?</i></p>
