            <p><i>The information in this article is based on my personal experience and is not professional financial
                    advice. The methods and strategies discussed may not be suitable for everyone, and your personal
                    financial situation should be taken into account.</i></p>
            <p>I used to be awful at managing my finances.</p>
            <p>I didn’t have a system in place to track my expenses, income, or net worth. I didn’t even know what a
                system would look like, and barely paid any attention to the important metrics of my money. This
                resulted in less than desirable financial outcomes for me. You can’t improve what you don’t measure, as
                they say.</p>
            <p>I eventually implemented a system, because I was tired of being broke and wanted to improve my financial
                situation. I educated myself through books and blogs and set up a rudimentary way to track my expenses.
                I was moving in the right direction, but the system was not quite there yet. It was too cumbersome and
                time consuming, which led to inconsistency in sticking to the process. It was also not comprehensive
                enough. Tracking expenses is just one piece of the puzzle. I felt dread each month when it came time to
                do my finances.</p>
            <p>After some iterations and revamping over several months, I eventually landed on a system that I felt good
                about. A system that was efficient, low effort, and dare I say, enjoyable.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, managing my personal finances is no longer a chore that I dread. Instead, it’s a quick and
                simple process that I don’t sweat and actually look forward to at the end of each month. It takes me
                around 2 hours of effort to handle everything on my personal finance docket, including income, expenses,
                net worth, and investments.</p>
            <p>My system is not perfect by any means, and will continue to evolve along with my wants and needs.
                Nonetheless, I wanted to share my current process in the event that others may find it helpful. This
                will also force me to refine and truly understand the process myself so that I can convey it
                effectively.</p>
            <p>Without further ado, here is the exact playbook of how I manage my personal finances in 2 hours of effort
                per month. You can also check out the YouTube video I made on the process (coming soon).</p>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Before I dive into the nitty gritty, I think it is important to provide some context on my personal
                situation. The amount of effort it takes to manage your finances will largely depend on the level of
                complexity in your own financial situation.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, what helps keep my finances manageable is that my family has a very simple financial setup.
                My wife and I share one single bank account. We also share one single credit card account. We both have
                our own credit cards that are linked to the same account. And since we buy pretty much everything with
                our credit cards, this funnels all of our expenses into one single bucket, making things much easier to
                track. Beyond this, we have a few shared investment and emergency fund accounts, and our own individual
                retirement accounts. And that’s pretty much it.</p>
            <p>I highly recommend consolidating and simplifying your financial situation as much as
                possible. It makes everything more manageable and clear.</p>
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p>Another recommendation I have before jumping into a new or revised personal finance process is to wrangle
                all of your online financial accounts.</p>
            <p>I personally use a password manager called Bitwarden to store all of my online account credentials.
                Bitwarden has a free basic tier and is a great, user-friendly tool. It is easy to set up and uses strong
                encryption to protect your data. You can also set keyboard shortcuts to quickly autofill your
                credentials as you navigate your online accounts.</p>
            <p>I also have a simple "finance" folder on my browser that stores bookmarks for all of my financial
                accounts
                and management tools. This combination of password and bookmark management helps keep everything in my
                financial life organized. It also allows me to fly through my accounts at warp speed when it comes time
                to sit down and do my monthly finances.</p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <h3>Part I: Tools</h3>
            <p>With those housekeeping items taken care of, let’s get down to brass tacks.</p>
            <p>There are a number of software tools out there to help you manage your personal finances. Well, to be
                honest, I only actually know of one called You Need a Budget, but I know for sure there are others out
                there. I have signed up for a free trial of You Need a Budget a few times, but could never get fully
                invested in the tool. Maybe I didn’t give it enough of a shot.</p>
            <p>My current system does not involve any paid software platforms. Instead, I use four simple spreadsheets
                to track and manage my finances. And I don’t even have Microsoft Office, so I do everything with Google
                Sheets.</p>
            <p>You can download all four of these Google Sheets for free from <a href="https://benhatch.com/shop/personalfinanceos">my shop</a> if you would like to open them up
                and follow along as we dive into the process. They are all fairly simple, and consist of a
                Monthly Expenses
                sheet, Income Tracker, Expense Tracker, and Net Worth Tracker.</p>
            <p>The process flows from one sheet to the next, in the same order as listed above. Let’s break down each of
                them and get into the details.</p>
            <h3>Part II: Monthly Expenses</h3>
            <p>I sit down to hammer out my personal finances once per month, at the beginning of the month, for the
                month prior. So on July 1st, for example, I will sit down and crunch the numbers for June.</p>
            <p>The first thing I do is review my Monthly Expenses sheet. This could also be considered a Monthly Budget
                sheet.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this sheet is to provide a snapshot of my average monthly expenses, and an allocation of
                what I can reasonably spend in a given month. It is broken into two parts: fixed and variable. Fixed
                expenses include things like rent, car payments, and monthly subscriptions. Variable expenses include
                groceries, dining, automotive, and any other expenses that vary from month to month. There are a few
                expenses that I pay annually upfront, such as my car insurance. I break these down into a monthly amount
                and incorporate them into my fixed monthly expenses to keep things simple. I also notate the details of
                the annual expense (i.e. Paid annually in full, next due 5/1/2025) in the Notes column of the sheet.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/monthly-expenses.png" alt="Screenshot of Monthly Expenses spreadsheet">
            </div>
            <p>From a formula standpoint, the Monthly Expenses sheet is very basic. It calculates total variable monthly
                expenses, total fixed monthly expenses, and total monthly expenses. I also throw in my after-tax income
                (averaged out), then calculate my target monthly discretionary income (monthly after-tax income - total
                monthly expenses).</p>
            <p>I don’t need to take much action on this sheet each time I run my finances. The main objective is to
                review my monthly burn and make sure it is fresh in my mind. Sometimes there may be a new expense I need
                to add, or an old one that needs to be removed. I also make a quick assessment of whether there are any
                expenses I want to axe from the list. Streaming services seem to be getting more obnoxious by the day
                with price increases, tiered ad plans, and all sorts of other nonsense. Disney+ may be next up on the
                fixed expense chopping block.</p>
            <h3>Part III: Income Tracker</h3>
            <p>As the name suggests, this sheet calculates and tracks all monthly income.</p>
            <p>The sheet is separated into two main sections, pre-tax and after-tax income, and has nine simple columns.
            </p>
            <p>I include columns for income from my regular W9 job, as well as a column for business income and “Other”
                (money from tax return, gifts, etc.). There are no fancy formulas here, just two columns that total
                pre-tax and after-tax income. I use the exact after-tax income amounts for my W9 job. I put 20% of all
                my business income away for tax savings, so for the after-tax business income column, I multiply pre-tax
                business income by 80% to arrive at this number.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/income-tracker.png" alt="Screenshot of Income Tracker spreadsheet">
            </div>
            <p>The Income Tracker also includes a separate tab to track total annual income, and charts for total
                monthly income and total annual income. For the annual income data, I manually update this typically
                after filing my taxes each year, but you could easily set up a formula to calculate the total from the
                monthly income amounts.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>Part IV: Expense Tracker</h3>
            <p>This is where I get into the meat and potatoes of what I actually spent for the month.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the Expense Tracker is to compile, categorize and calculate everything that I spent during
                the month. This feeds directly off of the Monthly Expenses sheet from Part II. If the Monthly Expenses
                sheet is the budget of what I can spend in a month, the Expense Tracker shows a detailed summary of how
                I actually did against this budget.</p>
            <p>I store a blank template version of this sheet, then work off of a
                copied version for each calendar year, and rename the file for the given year (i.e. 2024 Expense
                Tracker).</p>
            <p>This sheet is broken into three parts: raw transaction data, categorized expense data and discretionary
                income calculation. I will break down each section with tactical instructions below.</p>
            <p><span>Raw Transaction Data</span></p>
            <p>The first task at this step is to export my expense transaction data. As mentioned at the beginning of
                the article, my wife and I each have only one credit card, and the cards are connected to one shared
                account, which makes this step very quick and easy.</p>
            <p>Most, if not all, credit card companies allow you to download your transaction data from your online
                portal. For this step, I download a CSV of my credit card transactions for the month, upload this CSV to
                Google Drive, then convert the file to a Google Sheet.</p>
            <p>On the converted Google Sheet version, I then clean up the data. On my transaction files, the data
                includes a column with transaction date and posted date. I delete the transaction date column and keep
                the posted date. I also delete any rows that are accounted for in my fixed monthly expenses (more on
                that in a minute). The transaction data will also include credit card payments that I have made
                throughout the month, so I delete these rows as well. Finally, I format the columns to match exactly how
                the Expense Tracker columns are displayed.</p>
            <p>Once my exported credit card transaction data has been properly cleaned and formatted, I copy and paste
                the data over to the Expense Tracker. Although my family does most of our spending through this single
                credit card account, we do sometimes have transaction activity through our checking account. Therefore,
                I will also comb through our checking account transaction history at this step, then manually add in any
                necessary expense transactions to the list.</p>
            <p>The next task is to categorize the transactions. Since I removed any expenses that are accounted for in
                my fixed expenses, all of these transactions represent variable expenses and must be assigned one of the
                categories from the variable expenses section of the Monthly Expenses sheet from Part II. The category
                that is assigned must be an exact match, including case sensitivity, with how the category is listed on
                the Monthly Expenses sheet (you will see why in the next section).</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/raw-transaction-data.png"
                    alt="Screenshot of raw transaction data within Expense Tracker spreadsheet">
            </div>
            <p>For each transaction, I quickly assess the transaction details, then assign the proper category to it. My
                credit card company, and many others I’m sure, will assign their own category to each of your
                transactions and provide this in the downloaded data. I have found it useful to incorporate their
                default categories in my own data, which reduces the amount of manual category updating needed. I will
                also sometimes include a note for a given transaction in the Notes column. I find that most transactions
                are easily identifiable by the transaction details provided by the credit card data. For Amazon
                transactions, I will open up my Amazon order history, copy the dollar amount of the transaction, then
                search by this transaction amount to quickly identify the details of the
                purchase.</p>
            <p><span>Categorized Expense Data</span></p>
            <p>All of the work from the previous step pays off in this one.</p>
            <p>This section displays the fixed and variable monthly expense data from the Monthly Expenses sheet, with a
                slight twist. The fixed expenses section simply lists out the expense category and static dollar
                amount. The variable expenses section is where the magic happens. And by magic, I mean a simple SUMIF
                formula that calculates the totals for each variable expense category from your raw, categorized
                transaction data.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/categorized-expense-data.png"
                    alt="Screenshot of categorized expense data within Expense Tracker spreadsheet">
            </div>
            <p>As mentioned previously, the category that is assigned to each expense in the previous section must be an
                exact match with one of the categories from the variable expense category list, otherwise the SUMIF
                formula will not work properly. Performing a quick manual audit of one of the categories from the raw
                data can be helpful to make sure your formula is running correctly.</p>
            <p><span>Discretionary Income Calculation</span></p>
            <p>This final section of the Expense Tracker is nice and simple.</p>
            <p>Total Expenses (column J) performs a sum of all the fixed and variable expenses from column H. For Total
                After-Tax Income (column K), I copy and paste my total monthly after-tax income amount from the Income
                Tracker in Part III. Finally, Discretionary Income (column L) subtracts Total Expenses from Total
                After-Tax Income and displays my exact discretionary income for the month.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/discretionary-income-calculation.png"
                    alt="Screenshot of discretionary income calculation within Expense Tracker spreadsheet">
            </div>
            <p>This is one of the moments in the process where I either pump my fist in victory, or disperse a little
                blast of anxiety into the pit of my stomach. The Discretionary Income calculation in column L delivers a
                critical message each month. <i>Did I spend more than I took home? Or did I come out on top with some
                    extra
                    funds to play around with?</i></p>
            <p>I have found that it is not useful to worry too much if you do end up in the red in a given month. There
                is an ebb and flow to our financial lives. Some months are calm and the going is easy. Other months, it
                feels like every possible surprise expense is popping out of the woodwork and scheming to take you down.
                I
                have also found that having the hard data to look back on and analyze is very helpful in determining
                where you may have overspent, and course correcting going forward. It brings me great peace of mind to
                know that I have a strong handle on the data, and will quickly recognize if I start veering off track.
            </p>
            <p>This monthly discretionary income calculation also feeds directly into my investment process. I will
                assess what I have left over in discretionary income each month, then allocate some of this money into
                my investment accounts. I don’t currently have any auto-deposits set up for my investments. I take a
                manual approach based on how I did in a given month. I hope to set up some auto-deposits once I reach a
                more comfortable income to expense ratio.</p>
            <h3>Part V: Net Worth Tracker</h3>
            <p>This is my favorite part of the process, so I save it for last, as a treat.</p>
            <p>The Net Worth Tracker stores the value of my financial assets and debts, and calculates the running
                monthly
                total of my net worth. It also has a nice chart that visualizes the monthly change over time.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/net-worth-monthly.png" alt="Screenshot of Net Worth chart">
            </div>
            <p>The process to fill in this sheet each month is very simple. I log into each of my financial accounts,
                then record the value of the account in the corresponding field on the sheet. As mentioned in the Setup
                section of this article, having all of my accounts nicely organized in a password manager and in a
                browser bookmark folder makes this process a breeze. It takes me around 10 minutes to populate all the
                data for the month.</p>
            <p>For the assets section of the sheet, I label and arrange my accounts by liquidity. The most liquid
                account is listed to the far left in column B, and the rest cascade to the right in liquidity from
                there. Within the asset columns, I label retirement and college fund accounts in yellow to separate them
                from non tax-advantaged accounts, which are labeled with a blue background. The debt columns on the
                sheet are all labeled with a red background.</p>
            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="blog-images/net-worth-tracker.png" alt="Screenshot of Net Worth Tracker spreadsheet">
            </div>
            <p>The cool thing about this sheet is that it can be used for a lifetime, if you so choose. There is just
                one row for each month, so even if you become a disciple of <a href="https://x.com/bryan_johnson"
                    target="_blank">Bryan Johnson</a> and live to be 300 years old, the sheet will easily be able to
                handle 3,600 rows of data.</p>
            <p>I find that popping in to check and record my net worth once per month works well for me. It’s infrequent
                enough that I am not obsessing over the number, but frequent enough to provide valuable data and
                insights.</p>
            <div class="div-line"></div>
            <p>As mentioned at the outset, my system is not perfect. I am sure there are some gaps and flaws in there.
            </p>
            <p>Nonetheless, just as with diet, exercise, or any other personal initiative, the imperfect
                process that you are able to stick to is far better than the perfectly polished one that you can’t
                maintain consistently.</p>
            <p>If you made it this far, I hope you found something useful for your own personal finance process, or got
                some entertainment from my bad dad jokes. You can download all four of the sheets described in this
                article over at <a href="https://benhatch.com/shop/personalfinanceos">my shop</a>, and check out the video breakdown of this article over on YouTube
