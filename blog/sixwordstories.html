            <p>I have recently taken great interest in flash fiction.</p>
            <p>Flash fiction is a style of very short storytelling that conveys a full narrative in a highly condensed
                form. Writers of flash fiction must use creativity amidst word count constraints to tell a complete
                story with a beginning, middle and end.</p>
            <p>Flash fiction stories range from a few words up to 1,000. There are also some specific genres. Microfiction is 300 words or less.
                Drabbles are exactly 100 words. Then there’s the six-word story.
            </p>
            <p>Back in the roaring 20’s, the legendary novelist Ernest Hemingway was having lunch at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquin_Hotel" target="_blank">The Algonquin</a> with
                some fellow writers. Hemingway made a ten dollar bet with his pals that he could write a novel in six
                words. He scribbled his six-word story down on a napkin and passed it around the table. The writers
                unanimously bowed their heads in defeat then forked their money over to Hemingway. The story on the
                napkin read:</p>
            <p>For sale: baby shoes, never worn.</p>
            <p>As it turns out, this Hemingway story is likely a tall tale. Nonetheless, this six-word short has
                remained attributed to him over the years, and the six-word story format has stuck around.</p>
            <p>To join the flash fiction fun and flex my creative muscles, I penned a few of my own six-word stories,
                including a few takes on the “six-word memoir” subgenre.</p>
            <h3>Six-word stories</h3>
            <p>First came ChatGPT. Then, the humanoids.</p>
            <p>Humanity has fallen. AI reigns supreme.</p>
            <p>Big Bang. Dinosaurs. Homo sapiens. Superintelligence.</p>
            <p>They swiped right then got struck.</p>
            <p>She loved humor. His jokes killed.</p>
            <h3>Six-word memoirs</h3>
            <p>Loss. Grief. Psychosis. Despair. Redemption. Fatherhood.</p>
            <p>My pain has turned to pride.</p>
            <p>I miss mom more than ever.</p>
