        <p>Most of the time, I feel like a loser and a failure.</p>
        <p>It’s not rational thinking, and I know it’s not the truth, but nevertheless the thought persists.</p>
        <p>The reason I feel this way boils down to one single source: money.</p>
        <p>I’m 33 and not where I want to be with my finances.</p>
        <p>Friends and family around me are buying homes, taking trips and advancing in their careers.</p>
        <p>I’m just not quite there.</p>
        <p>Mentally, I understand that comparison is the thief of joy. Emotionally, I am constantly comparing my financial situation to my friends and peers, and feeling jealously and shame. It’s not pretty, but it’s the truth.</p>
        <p>I ended up in this situation through no fault but my own. A combination of bad career moves, pursuing passions over financial security, and neglecting my mental health has led me here.</p>
        <p>Often times, I am reminded that I am actually very lucky. I am healthy, live in a safe place, have good friends and family, and have a roof over my head. Gratitude takes over and I am able to count my blessings and appreciate the moment.</p>
        <p>But inevitably, something pops up — a medical bill, a car repair, a price increase — that reminds me how tight money is and sends me back into the financial obsession thought loop. Even seeing an Instagram post of someone’s new house or travels abroad will stir up these feelings of worthlessness. It’s pathetic, but it’s reality.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, as with most struggles in life, there is a silver lining to my money problem: hunger.</p>
        <p>My hunger to succeed financially and provide a secure future for my family has grown into something massive and kinetic. I have developed a chip on my shoulder that I’m not sure will ever fade.</p>
        <p>I have also decided that one of my only life goals for the foreseeable future is solving the money problem.</p>
        <p>When I take an honest look at my life, I have pretty much everything one could ask for. A wonderful wife, a beautiful baby boy, a healthy mind and body, a chance at success.</p>
        <p>The one, big, ugly missing piece is money.</p>
