        <p>Six and a half years ago, Ryan Gilbert sent out a tweet that would foreshadow a life-changing journey.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
            <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Do you know anyone with an awesome workspace?</p>&mdash; Ryan Gilbert (@rjgilbert) <a
                href="https://twitter.com/rjgilbert/status/724778161645477888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 26, 2016</a>
        </blockquote>
        <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>Two weeks later, he released the first edition of his new side project, Workspaced, "a weekly newsletter that
            brings you inside the workspaces of inspiring creatives."</p>
        <p>Ryan Hoover, the Founder of Product Hunt, was the first to be <a
                href="https://medium.com/workspaced/workspaced-001-ryan-hoover-b25dd6a8d1c3#.bwm8gnv1o"
                target="_blank">featured</a> in the fledgling newsletter.</p>
        <p>Ryan went on to publish 16 more editions of Workspaced, compiling stylish photos and short synopses of the
            workspace setups of designers, writers and entrepreneurs.</p>
        <div class="blog-image">
            <img src="blog-images/workspaced.png" alt="An image of the landing page of Workspaced.">
        </div>
        <p>Then, at the end of November 2016, the newsletter posts abruptly stopped.</p>
        <p>"I started Workspaced at a time when I had a nonexistent social following and extremely limited network,"
            Ryan told me over Twitter DMs. "It made it tough to get started and stay motivated."</p>
        <p>For the next two years, Ryan tabled his side project ambitions, but his passion for startups and indie making
            never faltered.</p>
        <p>He continued to tweet about business and bootstrapping and share articles that he was ingesting from founders
            and makers like <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin" target="_blank">Justin Jackson</a>, <a
                href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried" taret="_blank">Jason Fried</a> and <a
                href="https://twitter.com/tferriss" target="_blank">Tim Ferris</a>. He was also apparently sitting on a
            few killer domain names at the time.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

        <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>Eventually, like all true indie makers and entrepreneurs, Ryan caught the side project bug once again and
            began building.</p>
        <p>In January of 2019 he launched <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/frequently"
                target="_blank">Frequently</a>, "the easiest way to set up FAQ pages for your company."</p>
        <p>For the next year, Ryan chipped away at Frequently and dutifully committed to the build-in-public ethos. He
            shared his metrics each month while adding new features, improving design and spreading the word.</p>
        <p>Ryan sent the final build-in-public update on Frequently in February of 2020, roughly one year into the
            venture and at the precipice of a looming global pandemic.</p>

        <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>Frequently had seen some initial traction and success, but the project just wasn't quite the right fit. "I
            was non-technical and couldn't implement feature requests quick enough to truly make a dent in a space that
            needed quick iteration," Ryan explained.</p>
        <p>Ryan went silent on Twitter for the next month (something we should all take a page out of his book on), then
            came back online in March with a tweet announcing a new, yet familiar, venture.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
            <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Workspaces üñ•‚òïÔ∏è <a
                    href="https://t.co/kaayXUbvj2">https://t.co/kaayXUbvj2</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Gilbert (@rjgilbert) <a

        <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>"Revisiting Workspaces was perfect timing, unfortunately really," Ryan told me. "COVID had everyone working
            from home and it just seemed like the perfect time to take my learnings over the years and really go for it
            this time."</p>
        <p>With a Facebook-esque minor name change, a fresh logo, the power of Substack, all of his prior indie making
            experience, and a pandemic that was about to lock millions of creatives into their homes for months on end,
            Ryan was poised to hit the ground running.</p>

            <img src="blog-images/workspaces-substack.png"
                alt="An image of the landing page of the Workspaces Substack">
        </div>
        <p>The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
        <p>Since re-launching the newsletter in early 2020, Ryan hasn't missed a single week of publishing. He cites <a
                href="https://www.starterstory.com/stories/workspaces" target="_blank">consistency</a> as one of the key
            levers of growth and success for Workspaces.</p>
        <p>Another key growth tactic has been the traction loop baked into the Workspaces model. Makers submit their
            setups to the newsletter, Ryan shares their features on Twitter, then the makers retweet Ryan's posts to
            showcase their snazzy workspace to their audience. Wash, rinse, repeat.</p>
        <p>Ryan's consistent execution combined with some light iteration on the concept ‚Äì he eventually incorporated
            more setup photos and a short Q&A section to each edition ‚Äì resulted in 6,500 subscribers and $2,000 per
            month in revenue by June of 2022, when he shared his metrics and conducted an AMA on <a
                href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/my-newsletter-is-making-2-000-per-month-with-6-500-subscribers-ama-d4875ae489"
                target="_blank">Indie Hackers</a>.</p>
        <p>The ripples of success from Workspaces have spilled over not only to Ryan and his featured guests, but also
            to sponsors of the newsletter.</p>
        <p><a href="https://loops.so/" target="_blank">Loops</a>, a YC-backed "Email for SaaS" startup, saw an immediate
            ROI from their very first Workspaces ad slot. This led to a "random idea" proposed to Ryan from <a
                href="https://twitter.com/frantzfries" target="_blank">Chris Frantz</a> of Loops, followed by some back
            and forth discussions and then ultimately, a deal.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

        <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>Ryan now continues to grow and spearhead Workspaces, which recently surpassed the 10,000 subscriber mark, as
            the content arm of Loops as he takes on additional marketing initiatives for the team.</p>
        <p>The acquihire of Ryan and Workspaces by Loops is an intriguing play for a company still in its first year of
            infancy. This trend seems likely to continue with earlier stage players as more startups realize the power
            of an established and symbiotic media brand.</p>

        <p>I've been a huge fan of Workspaces since I discovered the newsletter earlier this year and couldn't be
            happier for Ryan and his success with the project. He is a kind-spirited indie maker who shines a spotlight
            on other creatives, shares everything that he learns and gives back to the community.</p>
        <p>I look forward to checking out all the awesome workspaces that Ryan and the Loops team have yet in store for
            us. I'll be over here at my subpar maker station dreaming about one day having a setup as cool as their
            guests.</p>
