                <h3>Recalibrating</h3>
                <p>This year has brought about many changes in my life. It's my first full year as a dad. I jumped into a new role at work within a new department. I traveled to Asia for the first time. I moved to a new apartment in a new town.</p>
                <p>I have also gone through some changes in my extraciricular business endeavors. I took a break from running my design agency, did some work on my personal brand, started a YouTube channel, got back into writing.</p>
                <p>I am now in a place where I feel ready to recalibrate, to focus in on the projects and activities with the biggest potential impact, and that excite me the most.</p>
                <p>So that is where I find myself now. Reviving some old projects, planning some new ones, and enjoying the process as I go.</p>
