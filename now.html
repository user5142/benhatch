            <h3>Launching MrMarket</h3>
            <p>For the past few years, I have pursued web and brand design as my main extracirricular business endeavor.</p>
            <p>I had some experience with design, so it seemed natural to pursue it as a way to make some extra money.</p>
            <p>I have had some modest success and worked with some great clients, but something always felt slightly off about doing design work. My heart was always halfway in. It felt like maybe there was a different path I was meant to pursue.</p>
            <p>Well, as of a few days ago, I have decided to no longer ignore these signs. I have committed to giving up design work and pursuing a different path.</p>
            <p>I spent some time thinking about new ideas and directions, but did not want to stay in this analysis for too long. I am hungry and motivated to tackle a new challenge.</p>
            <p>After laying out some basic criteria and ideas, I have settled on my next path. I will be launching a YouTube-led media brand called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrMarketStories" target="_blank">MrMarket</a>. I don't know precisely what shape or form the brand will take on, but to start, I will be following my curiosity and making videos that tell stories about money and oddities of the market.</p>
            <h3>100 Videos</h3>
            <p>As part of my new MrMarket endeavor, I have committed to a personal challenge: produce 100 videos for the MrMarket YouTube channel.</p>
            <p>I believe this challenge will help keep me focused and give me the best chance to launch a successful brand.</p>
            <p>There is one simple rule: the videos must be longform (longer than one minute). I may also be posting YouTube Shorts, but these won't count towards the challenge.</p>
