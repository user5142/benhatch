                        cooking

                            Snider</a>. Myles is a professionally trained chef with a passion for teaching and home
                        cooking. His 80/20 Cooking course provides students the fundamental and hands-on cooking
                        knowledge needed to confidently prepare delicious and healthy meals at home.</p>
                    <p>I connected with Myles shortly after he launched the course and as he was preparing for the
                        second cohort. Myles hired me to build out an 80/20 Cooking brand identity, re-design and
                        develop the course
                        landing
                        page and design course material assets.</p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The 80/20 Cooking brand and landing page needed a more professional look and feel to match
                            the high-quality curriculum and positioning of the course</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Myles felt he was not capturing as many leads as he could due to friction in the conversion
                            flow
                        </li>

                        <br>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>The research phase of the project involved analyzing online course businesses similar to 80/20 Cooking
                that had strong designs and followings, as well as assessing which web platform to utilize for the
                landing page.</p>
            <p>Both Carrd and Framer were assessed as viable and low-cost options, with Framer ultimately winning out as
                the platform of choice for the site. The ability to simultaneously design and develop in Framer as well
                as for
                Myles to have full content editing control were the main draws.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-paragraph">
            <h2>Design process</h2>
            <p>Myles and I worked together in an asychronous and iterative fashion which allowed us to create a tight
                feedback loop and make progress
                quickly.</p>
            <p>The first phase of the project was to dial in a logo and brand identity. I presented two logo concepts to
                Myles, then iterated on his favorite until we landed on a final design that we both felt great about.
                I also worked with Myles to define the colors, typography and visual style of the brand, and created
                vector illustrations to be used across the website, social and other marketing channels.</p>

        <div class="case-study-paragraph">
            <p>From there, we jumped into the course landing page design. I designed a few sections in Figma to get a
                feel for the style and structure, then moved the project into Framer to continue designing while
                simultaneously building things out.</p>
            <p>I provided Myles with a live link to the Framer build, which allowed for continuous and rapid feedback.
                The full brand identity, landing page design and Framer build out was completed in 1 month, giving Myles
                plenty of time to launch and promote the second 80/20 Cooking cohort.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>With the significant enhancements made to the brand identity and landing page designs, Myles was able to increase conversion rate of leads as well as student sign-ups for the course. He now has a solid foundation to build upon as he grows the course, and can easily update content on the 80/20 Cooking landing page for future cohorts.</p>
