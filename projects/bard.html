                <div class="two-column-right">
                    <p>Bard is a conversational AI chat service developed by Google and powered by its large language
                        model,
                        PaLM. Bard can be used to answer questions, generate text, translate languages, write different
                        kinds of
                        creative content, and much more.</p>
                    <p>Bard is currently only available as a browser-based web application. For this project, I asked
                        the
                        question, “What would a Bard mobile app look like?” and challenged myself to adapt the existing
                        Bard
                        web
                        app into a high-fidelity mobile app in Figma.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I had good familiarity with the Bard web application going into this project as a regular and
                enthusiastic user of the product.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I kicked off the project by taking screenshots of the Bard web app user journey in both desktop and
                mobile browser modes and transposing them into Figma.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="../images/bard-mobile-browser-screenshots.png"
            alt="A screenshot of the Bard web app on a mobile sized browser.">
        <div>
            <p>My next step was to familiarize myself with Google Material Design, a design system created and used by
                Google across all of its products. I studied Material 3 (the latest version of the design system), added
                the Material Symbols icon plugin to Figma, and duplicated the Material 3 Design Kit open-source Figma
                community file.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To round out the research phase, I studied and took screenshots of several existing Google mobile
                applications to get a sense of the consistency and UI patterns used across them.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Design process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Since I had an existing web application to work off of, I jumped straight into high-fidelity design of
                the Bard mobile app.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I designed 7 screens in Figma that cover the primary functionality of the app, as well as a Bard iOS
                mobile app icon. I created components for reusable elements such as the top navigation bar. I also
                utilized auto-layout for precise and consistent padding and spacing between elements.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I utilized guidelines from the Material 3 design system to select typography for the mobile app. For
                colors, I mimicked the colors and gradients of the Bard web app.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <br>
            <p>While I didn't have specific metrics to measure for this project, overall I am very happy with how the
                Bard mobile app concept turned out. Bard is a product I use daily, and this was very much a "scratch
                your own itch" kind of project. I designed a mobile app that I could see myself using and getting lots of
                value out of.</p>
