        <p>eggu eggu is a grocery shopping and meal planning mobile app concept that I designed in Figma.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The project consists of 12 different screens, which represent the primary functionality of the app.</p>
        <p>The app was designed with simplicy and functionality in mind, to allow the user to easily add to and check
            items off of their grocery list and weekly meal plan on the go.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I conducted research in the form of potential user interviews for this project. I spoke with half a dozen
            friends and colleagues and asked them questions around how they manage grocery shopping and meal planning. I
            also shared the eggu eggu prototype with them to get further feedback.</p>
